# Python-TFIDF
Introduction to TF-IDF: 
Computers do not process textual data to greater extent, unlike the numbers. One of the most widely used technique to process textual data is Term Frequency-Inverse Data Frequency (TF-IDF) . In this article, we will discuss about what are it's features and how it works! From our intuition, we think the words which appear most are significant and carry greater weight but that's not the case in textual data analysis. The words such as "the", "is", "a", "an" are called "Stop-words" and they appear most on corpus of text, but carry little significance and weight in textual data analysis. Instead, the words which are rare are the ones that actually help in distinguishing between data and carry more significance and weight.
